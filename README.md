#  Cellular Automata Playground in Unity

Langton's Ant:
A two-dimensional Turing machine with simple rules based on turning and flipping cell states. Despite its simplicity, the ant eventually creates a repeating "highway" pattern.

Conway's Game of Life:
A "game" where cells on a grid live, die, or reproduce based on the number of alive neighbors.

Brians brain:
A three-state automaton (On → Dying → Off). A cell turns "On" if exactly two neighbors are "On", then transitions through "Dying" to "Off". The result is chaotic, wave-like cool behavior.
